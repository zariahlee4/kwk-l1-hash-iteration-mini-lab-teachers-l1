### The Summer Olympics
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/sydney.jpg" width="300px" align="right" hspace="10"> The Summer Olympics take place every four years in different location around the world. Using the data from the table below, create a hash `summer_olympics`, using the city as the hash's key and the year as the hash's value. Use `:symbols` instead of string for the keys.


|Place          | Year      |
| ------------- |:---------:|
| Sydney        | 2000      |
| Athens        | 2004      |
| Beijing       | 2008      |
| London        | 2012      |

### Add A Key Value Pair
The 1996 summer olympics took place in Atlanta. Add this information to the hash.

### Iterate Through the Hash
Use the .each method to iterate through the .each`summer_olympics` hash and for each key-value pair `puts` a string that reads "The _____ summer olympics took place in ______."

### Iterate Through the Keys
Use the `each_key` method to return an array of the cities where each city name has been upcased. Save this to a new variable called `upcased_cities` and `puts` this to the screen.
